      <description>This project was developed as a final group assignment during the Artificial Intelligence course at my bachelor, which I took as requirement for obtaining of my minor in Systems Engineering.

A model of neural networks was used to classify tweets considering their sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.</description>
