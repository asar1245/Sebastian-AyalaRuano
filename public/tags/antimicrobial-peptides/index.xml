      <description>I have contributed to this project as part of my work as research assistant at the Applied Signal Processing and Machine Learning Research Group - Universidad San Francisco de Quito, in Ecuador.
Summary     Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small bioactive compounds, commonly with fewer than 50 amino acids, that have appeared as promising compounds to treat a wide range of diseases such as infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some types of cancer.</description>

      <description>I worked on this project during a summer research internship in 2018 at the Bio-Chemoinformatics Group - Universidad de Las Américas, in Ecuador.
Summary     Streptomyces clavuligerus is a Gram-positive bacterium that is a high producer of secondary metabolites with industrial applications. The production of antibiotics such as clavulanic acid or cephamycin has been extensively studied in this species; nevertheless, other aspects, such as evolution or ecology, have received less attention.</description>
