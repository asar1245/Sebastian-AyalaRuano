      <description>I contributed to this project as part of my work as data scientist consultant at Universidad de las Américas, in Ecuador.
Summary The initial species list comprised 636 unique names, which were filtered to delete duplicates and records identified at a genus level. The final list comprised 438 accepted names verified based on the Checklist of the Vascular Plants of the Americas (CVPA), publicly available on a website on the Missouri Botanical Garden database Tropicos.</description>

Background Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small bioactive drugs, commonly with fewer than 50 amino acids, which have appeared as promising compounds to control infectious disease caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria or superbugs. These superbugs are not treatable with the available drugs because of the development of some mechanisms to avoid the action of these compounds, which is known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</description>

Background Infectious diseases are a major threat for many crops of high importance for the food security of many regions of the world. Each year, around 60% of farmers in Ecuador have reported pre-harvest losses due to infectious agents such as fungi and bacteria, in crops like banana, cacao, and potato.</description>

      <guid>https://sayalaruano.github.io/project/ecuadorian_elections_2021_sentiment_analysis/</guid>
      <description>This project was developed as a final group assignment during the Artificial Intelligence course at my bachelor, which I took as requirement for obtaining of my minor in Systems Engineering.

Summary In this project, we captured sentiments of replies to tweets from two Ecuadorian presidential candidates in the 2021 elections (@LassoGuillermo and @ecuarauz). A model of neural networks was used to classify tweets considering their sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.</description>

      <title>The molecular basis of JAZ-MYC coupling, a key component of plant immunity</title>
      <link>https://sayalaruano.github.io/project/jaz-myc_coupling/</link>

      <guid>https://sayalaruano.github.io/project/jaz-myc_coupling/</guid>
      <description>I worked on this project during my bachelor, collaborating as undergraduate researcher at the Computational and Theoretical Chemistry Group - Universidad San Francisco de Quito, in Ecuador.
Summary The jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway is one of the primary mechanisms that allow plants to respond to a variety of biotic and abiotic stressors. Within this pathway, the JAZ repressor proteins and the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor MYC3 play a critical role.</description>
