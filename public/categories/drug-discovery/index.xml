      <description>I contributed to this project as part of my work as research assistant at the Applied Signal Processing and Machine Learning Group and the and the Grupo de Medicina Molecular y Traslacional - Universidad San Francisco de Quito, in Ecuador.
Summary Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small bioactive chemicals that have appeared as promising compounds to treat a wide range of diseases. The effectiveness of AMPs resides in the wide range of mechanisms they can use for both killing microbes and modulating immune responses.</description>

Background Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small bioactive drugs, commonly with fewer than 50 amino acids, which have appeared as promising compounds to control infectious disease caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria or superbugs. These superbugs are not treatable with the available drugs because of the development of some mechanisms to avoid the action of these compounds, which is known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</description>

      <description>I developed this project as the Midterm assignment for the Machine Learning Zoomcamp. Data Professor proposed the idea and dataset of this initiative, a collaborative Open Bioinformatics Research Project that is still in progress.
