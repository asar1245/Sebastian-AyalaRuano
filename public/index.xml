      <description>This project was built as a final group assignment during the Saturdays AI Quito 2021 artificial intelligence workshop.
Background     Infectious diseases are a major threat for many crops of high importance for the food security of many regions of the world. Each year, around 60% of farmers in Ecuador have reported pre-harvest losses due to infectious agents such as fungi and bacteria, in crops like banana, cacao, and potato.</description>

      <description>I worked on this project during the Global Intern Program 2019, a summer research internship at the Tumor Metabolism and Therapeutic Oncology Laboratory - Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, in South Korea. Also, my bachelor thesis was about this research topic.
Summary     Cereblon protein (CRBN) is the receptor for substrates that bind to the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, whose function is to control the selective degradation of proteins during various cellular processes.</description>

      <description>I worked on this project during a summer research internship in 2018 at the Bio-Chemoinformatics Group - Universidad de Las Américas, in Ecuador.
Summary     Streptomyces clavuligerus is a Gram-positive bacterium that is a high producer of secondary metabolites with industrial applications. The production of antibiotics such as clavulanic acid or cephamycin has been extensively studied in this species; nevertheless, other aspects, such as evolution or ecology, have received less attention.</description>

      <guid>/project/ecuadorian_elections_2021_sentiment_analysis/</guid>
      <description>This project was developed as a final group assignment during the Artificial Intelligence course at my bachelor, which I took as requirement for obtaining of my minor in Systems Engineering.
Summary     In this project, we captured sentiments of replies to tweets from two Ecuadorian presidential candidates in the 2021 elections (@LassoGuillermo and @ecuarauz). A model of neural networks was used to classify tweets considering their sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.</description>

      <description>I worked on this project during my bachelor, collaborating as undergraduate researcher at the Computational and Theoretical Chemistry Group - Universidad San Francisco de Quito, in Ecuador.
Summary     The jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway is one of the primary mechanisms that allow plants to respond to a variety of biotic and abiotic stressors. Within this pathway, the JAZ repressor proteins and the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor MYC3 play a critical role.</description>
