      <description>I contributed to this project as part of my work as data scientist consultant at Universidad de las Américas, in Ecuador.
Summary The initial species list comprised 636 unique names, which were filtered to delete duplicates and records identified at a genus level. The final list comprised 438 accepted names verified based on the Checklist of the Vascular Plants of the Americas (CVPA), publicly available on a website on the Missouri Botanical Garden database Tropicos.</description>

Background Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small bioactive drugs, commonly with fewer than 50 amino acids, which have appeared as promising compounds to control infectious disease caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria or superbugs. These superbugs are not treatable with the available drugs because of the development of some mechanisms to avoid the action of these compounds, which is known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</description>

Summary Streptomyces clavuligerus is a Gram-positive bacterium that is a high producer of secondary metabolites with industrial applications. The production of antibiotics such as clavulanic acid or cephamycin has been extensively studied in this species; nevertheless, other aspects, such as evolution or ecology, have received less attention. Furthermore, genes that arise from ancient events of lateral transfer have been demonstrated to be implicated in important functions of host species.</description>

Summary The jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway is one of the primary mechanisms that allow plants to respond to a variety of biotic and abiotic stressors. Within this pathway, the JAZ repressor proteins and the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor MYC3 play a critical role.</description>
