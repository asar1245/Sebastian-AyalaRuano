  My research experience has been primarily focused on **Phylogenetics** and **Structural Bioinformatics** to understand different biological phenomena, but now I am transitioning to **Network Science** and **Machine Learning** for drug discovery. 

  I have been part of some initiatives to boost Bioinformatics in Ecuador through the creation of the first [Regional Student Group from the International Society for Computational Biology Student Council in my country](https://rsg-ecuador.iscbsc.org/). Also, I am participating in some regional projects with people from different countries of Latin America. 

  Throughout the last year, I joined some open science and software development communities, including the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) and the [Streamlit Creators](https://streamlit.io/creators). In addition, I completed [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor training program, and I hope to teach my first course/lesson this year. 
  

  Some of my recent projects are presented below.
