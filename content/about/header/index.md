  Hi, I am Sebastián Ayala Ruano. Welcome!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a **research assistant** at the **Applied Signal Processing and Machine Learning Group** and the **Grupo de Medicina Molecular y Traslacional** - Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ), in Ecuador. My current work is focused on the development of a method based on network science and similarity searching to explore the **chemical space of antiparasitic peptides** and discover new potential drugs, which is available as a [preprint](https://doi.org/10.33774/chemrxiv-2021-tgv69). 

I completed my bachelor in **Biotechnology Engineering** as a major, and **Systems Engineering** as a minor at USFQ. Because of my major, I have learned about Microbiology, Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and other biological topics. Furthermore, through my minor, I have learned about algorithms, data structures, programming in various languages, and other computational skills. Due to my excellent academic record, I received the Magna Cum Laude distinction.

During my studies, I discovered that **Bioinformatics** is the field that captured my interest in research because it merges both of my background areas, Biotechnology and Systems Engineering. To pursue these interests, I have worked in various laboratories at my university such as the [Computational and Theoretical Chemistry Group](https://www.usfq.edu.ec/en/research/grupo-de-quimica-computacional-y-teorica), the **Applied Signal Processing and Machine Learning Group**, and the **Grupo de Medicina Molecular y Traslacional**; and research centers from institutions inside and outside of my country, including the [Bio-Chemoinformatics Group](https://bioquimio.udla.edu.ec/) at Universidad de Las Américas in Ecuador and the [Tumor Metabolism and Therapeutic Oncology Laboratory](https://life.gist.ac.kr/tmtor/) at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.

When I’m not working, I can be found riding my mountain bike, reading books about science communication, mystery, or history, hiking, listening to rock music, and watching thrillers or documentary films.
