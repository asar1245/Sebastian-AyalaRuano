  Hey, I am Sebastián Ayala Ruano. Welcome!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am a MSc student in [Systems Biology](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/systems-biology) at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/nl), the Netherlands. Previously, I worked as a research assistant and data science consultant at different institutes. In my last job, I developed a method based on network science and similarity searching to explore the **chemical space of antiparasitic peptides** and discover new potential drugs, which was recently published in this [article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.2c03398).

I completed my bachelor's degree in **Biotechnology Engineering** as a major, and **Software Engineering** as a minor at Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) in Ecuador. During my studies, I discovered that **Bioinformatics** is the field that captured my interest in research because it merged both of my background areas. To pursue these interests, I worked in various laboratories at USFQ such as the [Computational and Theoretical Chemistry Group](https://www.usfq.edu.ec/en/research/grupo-de-quimica-computacional-y-teorica), the **Applied Signal Processing and Machine Learning Group**, and the **Grupo de Medicina Molecular y Traslacional**; and research centers from institutions inside and outside of my country, including the [Bio-Chemoinformatics Group](https://bioquimio.udla.edu.ec/) at Universidad de Las Américas in Ecuador and the [Tumor Metabolism and Therapeutic Oncology Laboratory](https://life.gist.ac.kr/tmtor/) at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.

When I am not working, I can be found riding my mountain bike, hiking, listening to music, watching thrillers or documentary films, or reading books about science communication, mystery, or history.
