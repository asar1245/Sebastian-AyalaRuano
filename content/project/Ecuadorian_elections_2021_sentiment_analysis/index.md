excerpt: In this project, we captured sentiments of replies to tweets from 
  two Ecuadorian presidential candidates in the 2021 elections (@LassoGuillermo and    @ecuarauz). A model of **artificial neural networks** was used to classify tweets    considering their sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

This project was developed as a final group assignment during the Artificial Intelligence course at my bachelor, which I took as requirement for obtaining of my minor in Systems Engineering.

## Summary

In this project, we captured sentiments of replies to tweets from two Ecuadorian presidential candidates in the 2021 elections (@LassoGuillermo and @ecuarauz). A model of neural networks was used to classify tweets considering their sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The training dataset was obtained from the    [Workshop on Semantic Analysis at SEPLN (TASS)](http://tass.sepln.org/) of 2020, 2019, and 2012. Thus, we joined together data of the three editions in one dataset that had information about the id, text, and sentiment associated with tweets. Due to privacy politics we can not share the datasets here, but you can register in this [page](http://tass.sepln.org/2020/?page_id=74) and yo will access all datasets.

The main library used to build our model was [Keras](https://keras.io/) and we trained it using Google Cloud GPUs through `Google Colab`.
