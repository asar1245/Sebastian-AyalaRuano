This project was developed as the reference course material of a boot camp organized by [RSG Ecuador](http://https://rsg-ecuador.iscbsc.org) and [iGEM Ecuador](https://www.facebook.com/iGEMECUADOR), where I was instructor and co-organizer.

## Summary 
This project aims to create an **open educational resource** that introduces important concepts for aspiring Bioinformaticians, **written in Spanish**. Topics included in this resource are:

* The basics of GNU/Linux
* Jupyter Lab
* Terminal usage
* Text and file processing command-line tools (i.e. grep, sed), regex, and pipes
* Text and file processing Bioinformatics exercises
* Make command to install software
* SAM Tools: useful pipelines and software for Bioinformatics
* AWK: A programming language for text file processing
* Bash: Shell and programming language
* Git and GitHub for version control

The main problem that this project tries to solve is **the lack of unified and high-quality educational resources for Bioinformatics written in Spanish**. Considering that most of the resources to learn Bioinformatics are written in English, it could difficult for many students from Spanish-speaking countries to take advantage of these materials. Also, there are some Bioinformatics courses taught in Spanish, but the prizes to attend these events could be restrictive for students. Therefore, this project aims to tackle this issue by providing an open educational resource to learn fundamental Bioinformatics topics written in Spanish. 

Now, I am participating in the [4th cohort of Open Life Science program](https://openlifesci.org/ols-4) to improve this project and learn how to create and manage open educational and research resources. After this program, we will officially release this project with the proper licenses and content following the open science paradigm. 

## Additional information 

We generated the first version of this resource, available as an [e-book](https://rsg-ecuador.github.io/unix.bioinfo.rsgecuador/) powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) and GitHub Pages.
