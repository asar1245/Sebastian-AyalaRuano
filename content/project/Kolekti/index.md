This project was developed as the result of the Innovation challenge *For more data on labor informality* hackaton, organized by [Datalat](https://www.datalat.org/), [PNUD Ecuador](https://www.ec.undp.org/content/ecuador/es/home.html), [UN Women Ecuador](https://ecuador.unwomen.org/en), and [the International Labour Organization](https://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm).

## The hackaton  

The Innovation challenge *For more data on labor informality* hackaton searched for a **technological solution to collect labor informality data in Ecuador**. In the first stage of this challenge, there were 39 proposals from 80 interdisciplinary teams.

Then, three finalists teams were selected to create a prototype of the idea for one month.

## Our solution 

Kolekti was meant to be a friendly and innovative **webpage that gathered information from workers in labor informality and employers**, creating a community where all people could interact with each other and **generating suitable work opportunities**.

In this way, we created a **different way to collect and share data**. Kolekti’s architecture was based on two main data management schemes: **Open Data** and **Data Privacy**. The information would not only be available to everyone and give valuable insight, but it would also be protected, it would be anonymous and **the people who voluntarily share their data, will receive a lot of benefits**. These advantages include access to courses, events, informative blogs, a job portal, and a forum. The only thing we ask from the users in return is that they share their information about their employment status with us. 

Our solution would be able to present **reliable and up-to date information about the labor situation in Ecuador**, and at the same time, it would **create a community** in which people can learn, meet other people, solve their doubts and maybe even motivate themselves enough to start their own businesses.

With this technological solution **we were the winners of this hackaton**.

In addition, our project was selected to be presented at the [YouthLead Innovation Festival](https://www.un.org/youthenvoy/youthlead-innovation-festival-thematic-sessions/), organized by the United Nations offices.

This event gathered innovative youth-led solutions for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Kolekti was part of the Digital Technology Session of this event.
