Background Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small bioactive drugs, commonly with fewer than 50 amino acids, which have appeared as promising compounds to control infectious disease caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria or superbugs. These superbugs are not treatable with the available drugs because of the development of some mechanisms to avoid the action of these compounds, which is known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</description>

Background Infectious diseases are a major threat for many crops of high importance for the food security of many regions of the world. Each year, around 60% of farmers in Ecuador have reported pre-harvest losses due to infectious agents such as fungi and bacteria, in crops like banana, cacao, and potato.</description>

      <description>I worked on this project during a summer research internship in 2018 at the Bio-Chemoinformatics Group - Universidad de Las Américas, in Ecuador.
Summary Streptomyces clavuligerus is a Gram-positive bacterium that is a high producer of secondary metabolites with industrial applications. The production of antibiotics such as clavulanic acid or cephamycin has been extensively studied in this species; nevertheless, other aspects, such as evolution or ecology, have received less attention. Furthermore, genes that arise from ancient events of lateral transfer have been demonstrated to be implicated in important functions of host species.</description>
